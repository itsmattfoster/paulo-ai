## Prerequisites

Before you can run this app, you need to have the following installed:

### 1. Node.js and npm
- Download and install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/
- Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
- This will also install npm (Node Package Manager)
- After installation, verify by opening a new PowerShell window and running:
  ```powershell
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

### 2. OpenAI API Key
- Sign up or log in to OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/
- Go to API Keys section
- Create a new API key and save it securely

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open PowerShell in the project directory and run:
```powershell
npm install
```

This will install all required packages (may take a few minutes).

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

The app will start on http://localhost:3000

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## How to Use the App

### Step 1: Enter Your URLs
On the landing page, enter:
- Your website URL (e.g., https://yourwebsite.com)
- Your YouTube channel or video URL (e.g., https://youtube.com/watch?v=...)

**Note:** At least one URL is required. The YouTube video must have captions/subtitles enabled.

### Step 2: Analysis (takes ~1 minute)
The app will:
1. Scrape and analyze your website content
2. Extract transcripts from your YouTube videos
3. Use AI to create a detailed brand context profile

### Step 3: Create Content
Once analysis is complete, you can:
- Select different content modes (Ads, VSL, Emails, etc.)
- Chat with the AI to generate content
- The AI uses your brand context to create personalized content

## Content Modes

- **General**: General-purpose AI assistant
- **Ads**: Create compelling advertisements
- **VSL**: Video Sales Letter scripts
- **Emails**: Email marketing copy
- **Webinar**: Webinar scripts and content
- **Short-form**: Short scripts for TikTok, Reels, etc.
- **Long-form**: Detailed long-form content
- **Social**: Social media posts

## Troubleshooting

### "npm is not recognized"
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Restart your computer after installing Node.js
- Verify installation with `node --version`

### "Failed to analyze YouTube content"
- Ensure the video has captions/subtitles enabled
- Try using a different video from the same channel
- Make sure the URL is correct

### "Failed to analyze website"
- Verify the website URL is correct and accessible
- Some websites block automated scraping
- Try a different page from the same website

### API Errors
- Check that your OpenAI API key is correct in the `.env` file
- Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Check the console for detailed error messages
